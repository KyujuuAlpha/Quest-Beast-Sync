# Quest Beast Sync

Did not want to wait for SyncSaber to update, so created this app in the mean time.  This application synchronizes your BeastSaber bookmarks with your Beat Saber custom levels.

## Usage

1. Open the application under the `Unknown Sources` section on your Quest.
2. Set the username to whatever BeastSaber user's bookmarks you want to synchronize (this does not delete local levels).
3. Click synchronize and wait!

## Installation

The recommended installation method is by sideloading the APK through SideQuest.  Please follow the instructions on the SideQuest [download page](https://sidequestvr.com/download) if you don't have it installed already.

1. First download the latest APK from the `Actions` tab on this Github page
2. Follow [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/install-and-use-sidequest#install-a-custom-apk-3051314-9) on how to sideload the downloaded APK through SideQuest
